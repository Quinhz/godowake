# GodoWake
An alarm clock made in Godot 3.6 with no experience.

# The Challenge
The goal is to build a functional and fun mobile alarm clock from scratch in 7 days, learning Godot and GDScript along the way.

## Planned Features
- [x] Show Current time (v0.1.0-alpha)
- [x] Load Custom Wallpaper (v0.1.0-alpha)
- [x] Hotfix: use load() instead of image.load() to fix export warning.
